### 2️⃣ **PCB-Based 8-Bit CPU Design**

💾 Designed and implemented a CPU using Logic ICs and the CD40181 ALU.  
📐 **Highlights**: PCB design for backboard integration, micro-operations programming.

  <img src="Images/8.jpg" style="width: 10%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

🧠 This project dives deep into microarchitecture, with an 8-bit bus width, support for both 4-bit and 8-bit instructions, and 128 bits of RAM. The control unit and micro-ops programming are underway, and once done, everything will be mounted to a backboard. 
I have been working on my CPU project for about a month now. I managed to troubleshoot most of the PCBs and even tested them after integration.

Here, the CPU is adding one number (register A) to another number (register B) in a continuous loop. I still use a set of wires to do the CU part manually. First, I have to select the correct circuit of the ALU to do the addition. And load two numbers into the registers by fetching them from the RAM. Then, I setup the program counter to do a never-ending loop. 

I have learned a lot during this phase of the project and still have many things to learn in this CPU build journey.
