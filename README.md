## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1️⃣ **Custom 8-bit CPU on FPGA**
💾 Designed and implemented a CPU using Verilog and the CD40181 ALU.  
📐 **Highlights**: PCB design for backboard integration, micro-operations programming.

This CPU, centered around the CD40181 ALU, has been an incredible journey into the world of microarchitecture and instruction execution. Key features include an 8-bit bus width, support for both 4-bit and 8-bit instructions, and 128 bits of RAM organized into 16, 8-bit words. I've completed most of the CPU, but I'm still working on the control unit and programming micro operations (u ops). Once these components are finalized, I plan to mount all the circuits on a back board to create a cohesive and functional system.

This CPU design project has been a fantastic learning experience, allowing me to delve deep into the intricacies of processor design and operation. I'm thrilled to share my progress and look forward to any feedback or collaboration opportunities from the community. You can explore the project and dive into the details on my GitHub: [8-Bit CPU with CD40181 ALU on PCBs](https://github.com/OshadhaPathirana/8-Bit-CPU-with-CD40181-ALU-on-PCBs)

### 2️⃣ **PCB-Based 8-Bit CPU Design**
🛠️ An exploration of microarchitecture through a custom-designed CPU centered on the CD40181 ALU.  
📐 **Features**: 8-bit bus width, 4-bit and 8-bit instruction support, 128 bits of RAM, and micro-operations programming.

This project emphasizes hands-on learning in digital design, utilizing PCBs to bring the CPU to life. The final goal includes integrating all circuits onto a backboard for a cohesive and operational system. The GitHub repository features detailed documentation and ongoing updates: [8-Bit CPU with CD40181 ALU on PCBs](https://github.com/OshadhaPathirana/8-Bit-CPU-with-CD40181-ALU-on-PCBs).

### 3️⃣ **Smart Solar Inverter System**
🔋 A cutting-edge solution for efficient solar power generation with integrated IoT monitoring.  
🛠️ **Technologies**: Embedded C, Node-RED, MQTT, Power Electronics  
📈 **Outcome**: Enhanced energy efficiency and anomaly detection.

### 4️⃣ **SEIAN: Smart Energy Integration and Automation Network**
💡 Developed as part of the SLIoT Challenge 2023 by Team Dyson Sphere.  
📊 **Overview**: Addressed the critical need for real-time energy usage monitoring and optimization in industrial settings.

#### Core Features:
- **IoT Integration**: Smart Variable Frequency Drives (SVFDs) and Smart Power Converters (SPCs) transmit real-time power data via embedded Wi-Fi modules, enabling continuous insights into energy usage.
- **Simple Upgrades**: Existing VFDs and power converters can be upgraded to smart versions without major overhauls.
- **Fault Detection**: Early detection and reporting of device failures through the IoT network, minimizing downtime and preventing catastrophic breakdowns.
